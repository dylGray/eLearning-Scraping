What do responsibility and accountability have to do with the work of the modern seller, and why
does understanding them matter? More that you might realize--and that's why we want to
explore these concepts today.

Lesson 1 of 6
INTRODUCTION

You might be wondering...why this topic? And why now?

As you work to apply The Priority Sale concepts to your daily work, our experience tells us that
some of the most significant blockers to successful application DON'T actually come from
knowledge gaps.

Our experience shows us that self-limiting beliefs and unconsciously held habits can hold us
back from achieving our maximum possible success.

What kind of unconscious habits?

Sometimes, a task, thought, behavior, etc. becomes so routine it moves into the unconscious space in our brains. It's a good thing--imagine if you had to think about every key you pressed when typing, or every movement needed to drive a car.

But the subconscious can also be a haven for habits and routines that might be getting in our way--and we don't even realize it.

That's why, at key moments--like this one--we want to take the time to put the unconscious on
our radars so we can figure out if they belong in our future, or if it's time to work to let them go.

GETTING ALIGNED ON MEANING

Before we dive in, let's make sure we're all speaking the same language.

Responsibility and accountability are terms that have come to be used relatively
interchangeably, but we want to take a minute to distinguish the important differences
between each word. 

With this understanding in place, you can see two areas of self-awareness opening up. 

Responsibility...is a duty to complete an action.
For example, many sellers have a responsibility to complete sales calls. 

Accountability...is related to the consequences of those actions.
For example, sellers who complete sales calls are usually held accountable for the success of those calls.

You can ask yourself:
1. Am I RESPONSIBLE for the various expectations associated with my role? In other words, do I complete the tasks that I should?
2. Am I ACCOUNTABLE for the success or failure of the things I do (or don't do)? In other words, do I take ownership of how my actions turn out?

In other words, if we are people who take responsibility, we are people who satisfy the
expectations others have set for us (or that we've set for ourselves). And we are accountable
when we take ownership of how successful or unsuccessful we are in doing those things.

The difference between Responsibility and Accountability
 
Responsibility:
    - Updating the CRM
    - Making sales calls
    - Sending follow-up communications
    - Building a sales presentation
    - Meeting with a prospect

Accountability:
    - Losing a sale after a sales presentation
    - Receiving negative feedback in a customer email
    - Achieving your sales goal
    - Being invited to connect with a C-suite executive after sending an inquiry
    - Earning the trust of your prospect

Remember: 
- Responsibility relates to the COMPLETION of the things expected of us.
- Accountability relates to taking ownership of the CONSEQUENCES of what we have done (or not done).

Lesson 3 of 6
IDENTIFYING A CRITICAL BLOCKER

What can get in the way of us being responsible, accountable sellers?

It all seems so clear and straightforward...
- If we take responsibility and complete our tasks, and
- If we take accountability and own the outcomes of our tasks,

...we're doing our best to be conscientious sellers, great teammates, and exemplary employees. 

But sometimes...we don't get the results we want. Our great plans don't lead to the outcomes we hoped for. And when that occurs, it's much harder to want to be accountable. 

When that occurs, we sometimes get tripped up by the temptation to blame.

Let's see where blame tends to creep in.

Imagine that you're going about your work, completing the various steps and actions that allow
you to fulfil a responsibility of your role. When all is done, you get a good outcome--maybe you
make a big sale!--and because everything ended well, you focus entirely on your success, not
looking around for any of the factors that may have contributed along the way.

But now let's imagine the opposite situation, where you, after fulfilling your responsibility,
DON'T get a good outcome (your prospect turns you down, perhaps). In an instance like this,
it's tempting to look backward at the various moments leading up to this outcome.
 
And what are we looking for? Something or someone to blame, like other people, or other
companies, or even the weather or other universal forces, like this:

Lesson 4 of 6
REFLECTING ON BLAME AGENTS

Think about the last time that something didn't go exactly as you hoped or expected, either in your work or in your life in general. 

What types of things came to mind? Tiredness from a late night? Whether you'd had your
morning coffee? That person who got to your destination two minutes ahead of you, because
of that traffic that you encountered? That you were distracted thinking about a deadline or a
bill or a sick kid or an unexpected text? 

Whatever came to mind is a form of blame agent. We all have them--it's just human to look around for some way to make sense of why things have happened the way they have, especially when things didn't go as we hoped. 

Often, these blame agents sneak in without our awareness--becoming a sort of "secret" blame agent. But since we're focusing today on our unconscious habits, we want to bring our secret blame agents into the light.

Lesson 5 of 6
BLAME AND SALES

Does blame matter?

You might be thinking: Who cares if I blame the weather or my lack of coffee or the distraction of a sick kid or that seller from the other company? These things aren't harmed by my blame. They
don't know. They don't care.

It's a fair question. Many times, the things we point to as the reasons we failed will never know
about our blaming them. But what if we told you that blame might be hurting YOU?
